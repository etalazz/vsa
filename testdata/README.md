# Testdata

This directory holds fixtures and configuration snippets used by tests.

Currently used by E2E tests:
- scenarios.json: Describes example traffic scenarios discussed in the docs.

The E2E tests do not strictly require these fixtures today, but they document the intent and can be used by future table-driven tests.
